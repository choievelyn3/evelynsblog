I want to understand how much influence language and the sentiment have on the characters and the overall story.\n\n\n\n\nA few questions that I hope to answer through my project are:\n\n- Which words appear frequently in Pride and Prejudice? \n- How does Elizabeth Bennet's and Mr. Darcy's relationship develop as the story progresses?- Why do different genders in Pride and Prejudice speak differently, and how does this effect the novel's overall tone and message? \n- What significant events cause shifts in how people feel in Pride and Prejudice, and what causes those shifts to occur? \n- How do the sentiments of Pride and Prejudice's various social classes vary? \n- How can certain words or word categories help to develop the ideas of Pride and Prejudice? \n- How does Pride and Prejudice's evolving main characters and their relationship with one another shape the novel's tone? \n- What are some similarities and differences in the language and emotion used by the various characters in Pride and Prejudice, and how do these elements develop over the novel?\n\n# Additional Sources:\n\n- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/upshot/the-word-choices-that-explain-why-jane-austen-endures.html\n\n- Runge, Laura L. “Austen and Computation 2.0.” Texas Studies in Literature & Language, vol. 61, no. 4, Winter 2019, pp. 397–415.
