Austen's work stands out in the literary world because of her distinctive and unmatched writing style. My motivation with this data analysis project was to dive further into the impact of Austen's writing style, analyzing how they create character growth, understood the overall sentiment within the story, and the plot throughout the novel. \n\nIn revisiting the delightful world of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, I wanted to better appreciate the power of language and word choice in giving these characters life and setting the story's trajectory. I was eager to learn more about Austen's work and its profound influence on future generations of readers. Through this project, I was able to learn more about how her writing style by comparing her other novels like Emma, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion. Pride and Prejudice is an unrivaled example of Austen's influential writing and has left an enduring impression on the world of literature.\n\n\nA few questions that I hope to answer through my project are:\n\n- Which words appear frequently in Pride and Prejudice? \n- How does Jane Austen's writing style contribute to the overall tone of Pride and Prejudice? \n- How does the overall tone shift when a significant event occurs or is about to occur?\n- What role does dialogue play in Pride and Prejudice in the development of characters and the overall plot?\n- How can certain words or word categories help to develop the ideas of Pride and Prejudice?\n- How does the sentiment analysis results and the analysis in word frequency in 'Pride and Prejudice' compare to Jane Austen's other novels?
