Therefore, I assume that the data is accurate.\n\nFor data preprocessing, I will be removing any stopwords, unneccessary characters, and make the entire text lowercase to easily process the data.\n\n# Exploratory Data Visualization:\n\n# Beginnings of analysis\n\nFor the first steps of my analysis, I pre-processed the data, removing any stop words, making it lowercase and punctuations, to ensure that the data would be much more manageable. By making these necessary changes, it was much easier to create data visualizations. For the data visualizations, I created four representations, which includes word frequency, character networks, adjective recurrence, and the most common positive and negative words. Through my analysis of these visualizations, I will be able to further research on the overall tone, theme, and message of the novel and gain a better understanding of the language chosen by Jane Austen.\n\n# Additional 4 data Visualizations I'm interested in making\n\n1. a visualization that compares the language spoken by characters of different social classes\n2. sentiment analysis of part 1 and part 2 and how the tone shifts\n3. certain character interactions shift the tone of the novel, like for example, Lydia and Wickham's elopement\n4. textual analysis on different romantic relationships between couples in the novel, like Darcy and Elizabeth with Mr. Collins and Elizabeth\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"DataPreprocessingandInformation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Data Pre-Processing and Information","description":"Below is my data pre-processed, along with 4 data visualizations.","author":"Evelyn Choi","date":"03/13/2023","categories":["code","visuals","pre-processing"],"date-modified":"03/13/2023"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
