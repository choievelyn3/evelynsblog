Therefore, I assume that the data is accurate.\n\nFor data preprocessing, I will be removing any stopwords, unneccessary characters, and make the entire text lowercase to easily process the data.\n\n# Exploratory Data Visualization:\n\n# Beginnings of analysis\n\nI made four visualizations to display word use, character networks, adjective frequency, and positive and negative words. To further prepare the data for analysis, I removed punctuation and made the text all lowercase. In text analysis, this is a popular first step that helps get rid of clutter that doesn't add any value to the research. The next step I could take would be examining the visuals to learn more about the story's characters, their motivations, and the language they use.\n\n# Additional 4 data Visualizations I'm interested in making\n\n1. a visualization that compares the language spoken by characters of different social classes\n2. sentiment analysis of part 1 and part 2 and how the tone shifts\n3. certain character interactions shift the tone of the novel, like for example, Lydia and Wickham's elopement\n4. textual analysis on different romantic relationships between couples in the novel, like Darcy and Elizabeth with Mr. Collins and Elizabeth\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"output-file":"DataPreprocessingandInformation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Data Pre-Processing and Information","description":"Below is my data pre-processed, along with 4 data visualizations.","author":"Evelyn Choi","date":"03/13/2023","date-modified":"03/13/2023"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
